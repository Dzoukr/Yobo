# About this project
State of this project is rather untypical for public GitHub projects so please read lines below to fully understand my intentions and your limitations: 

## Is it OSS project?
Not in typical meaning. It's "free to look" public project I've created and maintained for my wife's yoga class, which is used in production. I am the only maintainer and I don't look for any other contribution. Its evolution is and will be driven by business needs only.

## Why is it public?
As a proud member of F# community I wanted to publish how the real project is done using F#, Fable, Azure Functions and other cool stuff. Even if you cannot contribute directly I believe it could be handy (if you're interested) to see how real project evolves.

## What licence is it?
None. :) By [definition of missing licence](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) it means:

> Without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work.

However let me be clear on this:

## Can I still use some parts of it for my own good?
Absolutely! And that's the reason I made this project public. Take any **code part** of the repository as do what you like. Really. It's built on the top of OSS libraries anyway, so I would be happy to somehow contribute back.

## So what's the limitation?
All graphic content (especially logo) and "Mindful Yoga" phrase are trademarks registered on [Úřad Průmyslového Vlastnictví](https://upv.cz/en.html) (Industrial Property Office in Czech Republic) so please avoid of reusing those.

## That's all?
Yup. Just clone the repo, delete trademarked `/src/Yobo.Client/public/img/logo.png`, rename "Mindful Yoga" to something else like "My Amazing Yoga Kickass Booking" (it's currently in [3 files](https://github.com/Dzoukr/Yobo/search?q=mindful) anyway, so no brainer here :-)) and we're all ok.
